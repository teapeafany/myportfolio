                        To understand how people discover and engage with music, we conducted interviews and surveys in September 2024. We received 40 survey responses and conducted 6 in-depth interviews with Georgia Tech students ages 18-24 who regularly use streaming platforms. The insights from these conversations revealed patterns in music discovery habits, emotional responses to recommendations, and social sharing behaviors that shaped our design direction.

                        To systematically organize insights from our interviews, we applied thematic analysis using coding and affinity mapping. We transcribed interviews in Taguette, tagged recurring patterns, and grouped similar codes in FigJam to identify broader themes. This process helped us move from individual observations to actionable design insights.

                        Through coding and thematic analysis, we confirmed that users actively seek new music but face distinct challenges in how they discover it.

                        Many participants reported getting bored of familiar songs, wanting music to match their changing moods, and seeking new songs as a way to refresh their playlists and maintain engagement.

                    <p class="insights-text">
                        Participants value moments of <strong>deep, uninterrupted engagement with music</strong>. Immersion was often described as a state where the listener is <strong>"pulled out of their thoughts"</strong> and fully absorbed in the sound.
                    </p>
                    <p class="insights-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                        Concerts and live performances were highlighted as strong triggers of immersion, offering lasting and memorable connections to songs and artists. Participants suggested that such immersive experiences counterbalance the fast-paced, disposable nature of trending sounds, creating opportunities for more meaningful and enduring relationships with music.

                    <p class="insights-text">
                        We found that users' listening choices are strongly shaped by external influences, both algorithmic (social media posts/Spotify-generated algorithm) and contextual.

                    <p class="insights-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                        These algorithms were described as convenient entry points for discovery, though they can create limitations by reinforcing familiar patterns. Participants also noted the <strong>frequency bias</strong>, where repeated exposure to a song (through social media's trending reels) increased its likability over time.

                        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Over 75% of participants listened to music while walking alone, exercising, or studying. This revealed that music serves different purposes—some use it to shift focus or break from tasks, while others use it to concentrate and enhance work engagement.
