                                        The concept of <strong>immersion</strong> emerged as a key factor. Participants described moments where music "pulls you out of your thoughts" and creates a deep, uninterrupted engagement. One participant noted: <strong>"I felt it way more than when I was just listening."</strong>
                                    </p>

                                        Concert experiences were highlighted as particularly immersive, offering lasting and memorable connections to songs and artists. The difference between listening to an album at home versus experiencing it live was profound—live performances created emotional connections that persisted long after the event.

                                        Beyond immersion, participants also valued attention to detail: the quality of beats, the complexity of instrumentals, and the depth of lyrics all contributed to a song's "listenability."

                                        Participants revealed that immediate music preferences are heavily influenced by <strong>contextual factors</strong>. Weather, mood, and environment all play significant roles in what someone wants to listen to at any given moment.

                                        <strong>Variability</strong> was another key theme—users crave diversity in their listening experience. One participant explained how <strong>scrolling on TikTok</strong> exposes them to new sounds, creating what they called a <strong>"sound stim"</strong> that influences their immediate preferences.

                                        The phenomenon of songs getting "stuck in your head" was also mentioned as a determinant of immediate taste. When a melody or lyric resonates, it creates an urge to listen to that specific song, often overriding algorithmic recommendations.

                            We determined that users consistently expressed a <strong>need for novelty in their listening experiences</strong>. Many participants reported getting <strong>bored</strong> of familiar songs, wanting songs to match their <strong>changing moods</strong>, and sought out new music as a way to <strong>refresh</strong> their playlists and maintain engagement. This desire manifested in two distinct approaches:

                        </h3>
                        <p class="po-box-text">
                            Participants value moments of <strong>deep, uninterrupted engagement with music</strong>. Immersion was often described as a state where the listener is "<strong>pulled out of their thoughts</strong>" and fully absorbed in the sound.
                        </p>
                        <p class="po-box-text">
                            Concerts and live performances were highlighted as strong triggers of immersion, offering lasting and memorable connections to songs and artists. Participants suggested that such immersive experiences counterbalance the fast-paced, disposable nature of trending sounds, creating opportunities for more meaningful and enduring relationships with music.

                            We found that users' listening choices are strongly shaped by external influences, both algorithmic (social media posts/spotify-generated algorithm) and contextual.

                        <p class="po-box-text">
                            These algorithms were described as convenient entry points for discovery, though they can create limitations by reinforcing familiar patterns. Participants also noted the frequency bias, where repeated exposure to a song (through social media's trending reels) increased its likability over time.
